# Nodes in Wiredoor

**Nodes** are the clients that connect to the Wiredoor Server via a secure WireGuard tunnel. They represent the entry point for exposing services that live inside private networks, devices, or environments that are not directly reachable from the internet.

This document explains how nodes work, how to connect them, and the difference between a regular node and a gateway node.

## What is a Node?

When you create a node in Wiredoor:

- A **WireGuard peer** is generated with a unique private key and assigned a static VPN IP (e.g. `10.12.1.3`).
- A **configuration file** is created, compatible with the official WireGuard client.
- An **API token** is issued, allowing the node to interact with Wiredoor using `wiredoor-cli`.

Once connected, the node can securely send and receive traffic through the Wiredoor Server.

  end

  public <--> |Traffic over SSL| wiredoor
  wiredoor <--> |Traffic| clients
  clients ==> |Tunnel| wiredoor
```

## Connecting a Node

There are multiple ways to connect a node:

### 1. Manual Connection (Any OS)

After creating a node in the Web UI:

- Download the WireGuard configuration file (`.conf`)
- Import it into any [WireGuard client](https://www.wireguard.com/install/)
- Activate the connection

This gives you a working VPN tunnel between your node and Wiredoor.

### 2. Using `wiredoor-cli` (Recommended)

`wiredoor-cli` is a lightweight client built in Go that can:

- Establish and manage the WireGuard connection
- Interact with the Wiredoor API
- Automatically expose or hide services from the command line

To use it:

1. Create a node in the Web UI
2. Copy the generated **token**
3. Run `wiredoor-cli` on the node and provide the token
4. Use CLI commands to connect, expose services, check status, etc.

(See [CLI documentation](./cli) for details)

## Node Lifecycle

Each node can be:

- 🟢 **Connected** — VPN tunnel is active and services can be exposed
- 🔴 **Disconnected** — VPN tunnel is disabled, services are not reachable
- ♻️ **Regenerated** — You can reset the WireGuard config and rotate the API token at any time
- 🗑️ **Deleted** — Permanently removes the node and all associated config

---

## What is a Gateway Node?

A **Gateway Node** is a special type of node that acts like a site-to-site VPN bridge.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  public[(Internet)]
  wiredoor(Wiredoor Server)
  subgraph Private network
    direction RL
    gateway[Gateway Server]
    clients@{ shape: procs, label: "Servers"}
  end

  public -- Traffic -->
  wiredoor <-- Traffic -->
  gateway ==> |Tunnel| wiredoor
  gateway <--> |Traffic| clients
```

Instead of only exposing services running on the node itself, a Gateway Node can:

- Forward traffic to **any host** in its local subnet (e.g. `192.168.1.100`)
- Allow Wiredoor to route external traffic to **multiple internal devices**, not just the node

> This is ideal for exposing:
> - Devices without WireGuard support (e.g. IoT, PLCs, cameras)
> - Services running on other LAN servers or virtual machines
> - Kubernetes or Docker networks

You can define allowed subnets when creating or editing a gateway node.

## Managing Nodes in the UI

From the Web UI, you can:

- 📥 Download the WireGuard config
- 🔑 View or regenerate the API token
- 🔌 Connect or disconnect the node
- ♻️ Reset WireGuard config and rotate the API token
- 🧭 View its VPN IP and connection status
- 🌐 Expose/Disable services
- 🔍 See which services are currently exposed

## Example Use Cases

| Use Case | Node Type | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Exposing a local dev server | Standard Node | VPN tunnel from a laptop or VM |
| Self-hosted dashboard on a NAS | Standard Node | Tunnel directly from the NAS device |
| Accessing an entire factory LAN | Gateway Node | Route to multiple devices behind a router |
| Publishing Kubernetes services | Gateway Node | Use Helm chart to tunnel from inside the cluster |
| Headless IoT Device | Gateway Node | Expose a device that cannot run WireGuard directly (via another node on the same LAN) |

---

## Next Steps

- Use [`wiredoor-cli`](./cli) to connect and expose services
- [Expose services](./usage) from your connected nodes
- Deploy a [Docker Gateway](./docker-gateway) or [Kubernetes Gateway](./kubernetes-gateway)
